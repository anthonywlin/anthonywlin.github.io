<ul>
  <li><em>433-330 Theory of Computation</em>
    <p>Subject Description:</p>
    <p>The objective of this subject is for students to understand the
    essence of computing through simple models of computational devices; to
    understand the limitations of computing, the relative power of formal
    languages and the inherent complexity of many computational problems of
    practical importance; to be able to apply these models in practice to
    solving problems in diverse areas such as string searching, pattern
    matching, cryptography, and language design; to be familiar with standard
    tools and notation for formal reasoning about machines and programs; and
    to improve reasoning and problem-solving skills.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Topics covered include formal languages, grammars and recognisers;
    models of computation: finite state machines, pushdown automata, Turing
    machines; computability: the Church-Turing thesis, decidability,
    reducibility; complexity: the classes P and NP, NP-complete problems,
    space complexity; and other topics selected from information and coding
    theory, lambda calculus, recursion theory, approximation algorithms,
    probabilistic algorithms, cryptography, quantum computing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>620-352 Graph Theory</em>
    <p>Subject Description:</p>
    <p>This subject introduces the basic concepts of graph theory including
    isomorphic graphs, subgraphs, connectedness, bipartite graphs, paths and
    cycles, trees, weighted graphs and distance in graphs, Steiner trees,
    matchings, flows and eulerian circuits. Students should develop the
    ability to implement algorithms on graphs for finding objects such as
    minimum spanning trees, maximum matchings and flows; and to implement
    approximation algorithms. Students should also develop the ability to
    prove simple results in graph theory. This subject demonstrates the
    variety of applications of graph theory within and outside
    mathematics.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Introduction to graph theory topics include the concepts listed above,
    but may also include colouring properties, combinatorics, and the
    probabilistic method</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>620-443 Topics in Graph Theory and Enumeration</em>
    <p>Subject Description:</p>
    <p>The use of generating functions for enumeration of combinatorial
    structures, including partitions of numbers and of sets, permutations
    with restricted cycle structure, connected graphs and other types of
    graph; solution of recurrence relations; methods of asymptotic
    enumeration; some applications in statistical mechanics.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>This course is very general. The methods covered have widespread
    applicability, including areas of pure and applied mathematics and

    Industry, Management, VLSI Layout, Transportation, Telecommunication,
    Computer Networking, Information Processing, etc. This subject is an
    introduction to Network Optimization with focus on important ideas,
    theoretical results and algorithms. It covers classical problems that can
    be solved in polynomial-time, and some more difficult (NO-hard) problems
    for which polynomial-time algorithms are unlikely to exist. Topics are
    selected from; Problems and Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortest
    Paths, Maximum Flows, Minimum Cost Flows, Multicommodity Flows, Maximum

<h3>Pure Mathematics</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>620-222 Linear and Abstract Algebra</em>
    <p>Subject Description:</p>
    <p>This subject develops the theory of linear algebra, building on
    material in earlier subjects and providing both a basis for later
    mathematics studies and an introduction to topics which have important
    applications in science and technology. It also introduces the theory of
    groups, which is at the core of modern algebra, and which has
    applications in many parts of mathematics and in theoretical physics.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Linear algebra topics include revision and extension of basic
    concepts; vector spaces including complex spaces, inner products, linear
    transformations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, dual spaces and the
    connection with inner products; the spectral theorem for normal matrices;
    and Jordan normal form, without proof but with applications. Groups
    topics include abstract groups, examples including matrix groups and
    permutation groups; homomorphisms, normal subgroups, quotients and the
    first homomorphism theorem; group actions and permutation groups; and
    conjugacy classes and their interpretation in symmetry groups,
    permutation groups and matrix groups. Applications topics may include
    wallpaper groups, symmetry groups of regular polyhedra, and permutation
    groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>620-311 Metric Spaces</em>
    <p>Subject Description:</p>
    <p>This subject introduces the generalised distance between elements of
    an abstract set, including sets of functions. It also introduces the
    notion of a general topological space, and the generation of such space
    from a metric space and from other structures. It emphasises the
    significance of completeness of a metric space and of the concepts of
    compactness and connectedness. Students should develop the ability to
    apply abstract methods of topology to obtain deeper results about real
    and complex numbers and Euclidean spaces, and to apply metric space
    methods to the approximate solution of linear equations, and differential
    equations by Picard's method. They learn to distinguish between pointwise
    and uniform convergence from the viewpoint of topology, and to understand
    the difference between topological and metric properties of topological
    spaces. This subject demonstrates the power of abstract topological
    concepts as applied to Euclidean spaces, to concrete spaces of functions,
    and to the approximate solution of equations. It also develops an
    appreciation of the rigorously presented concepts of convergence and
    continuity, the use of topology in the modern treatment of numerical
    mathematics, differential and integral equations, optimisation, logic and
    computing.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Topics include the concept of a metric and of the induced topology;
    open and closed sets; convergence and completeness; the contraction
    mapping theorem; continuity, uniform continuity and homeomorphism;
    compactness; connectedness; and applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>620-321 Algebra</em>
    <p>Subject Description:</p>
    <p>This subject provides further experience with abstract algebraic
    concepts and methods. General structural results are proved and
    algorithms developed to determine the invariants they describe. The
    material covered is widely used in algebraic topology and in number
    theory.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Rings topics include abstract rings and isomorphisms; examples
    including matrix rings and polynomial rings; homomorphisms, ideals and
    quotient rings; integral domains and the field of quotients; units,
    irreducibles and primes; prime and maximal ideals; integral domains and
    the field of quotients; and Euclidean domains and principal ideal
    domains. Modules topics include submodules, homomorphisms of modules and
    quotient modules; free modules and bases; structure of a finitely
    generated module over a principal ideal domain; and applications to
    abelian groups and to Jordan normal form of matrices. Field theory topics
    include field extensions and their construction; and the degree of a
    field extension. Applications topics may include tensor and exterior
    algebras, applications to number theory, the classical impossibility
    theorems, and structure theory for simple rings.</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>620-322 Topology</em>
    <p>Subject Description:</p>
    <p>This subject introduces the basic concepts and examples of topological
    spaces, the definition of manifolds and the classification of surfaces,
    the idea of homotopy of mappings, the concept of covering spaces and
    their relationship with fundamental groups, and the basic ideas of
    homology theory. Students should develop the ability to work with the
    fundamental group and homology groups, to calculate and use the
    fundamental group, to convert problems involving topological spaces and
    continuous maps into problems in algebra, to distinguish between
    different topological spaces, and to construct homeomorphisms and
    homotopy equivalences between spaces. This subject investigates the basic
    questions in topology. It demonstrates the power of topological methods
    in dealing with problems involving shape and position of objects and
    continuous mappings, and shows how topology can be applied to many areas,
    including geometry, analysis, group theory and physics.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Topics include topological spaces and continuous maps; quotient
    spaces; homotopy and fundamental groups; surfaces; covering spaces; and
    an introduction to homology theory.</p>
