    <h2>One Postdoc Position Available
  </h2>

  <p>
One postdoctoral research fellowship is available at Yale-NUS College,
Singapore, on the topic of <i>String Constraints for Vulnerability Analysis in 
Web Applications</i>. Applicants should have expertise in two or more of 
the following fields: 
  </p>
  <ul style="line-height: 150%">
      <li>Software verification/program analysis.</li>
      <li>Web security.</li>
      <li>Logic and automata</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
The project will focus on both foundational issues (including decidability, 
complexity), and implementation issues (including benchmarking, and heuristics 
for optimising string solvers). 
  </p>

  <p>
Applications will be assessed on a first-come, first-served basis. Initial 
appointment is for one year and will be extended upon satisfactory 
progress. 
  </p>

  <p>

  information. Enquiries and expression of interests are welcome.
  </p>

About Working at Yale-NUS
  </h2>

  <p>
The research will be conducted at Yale-NUS College. Yale-NUS College is a small 
liberal arts college located within National University of Singapore (NUS). An 
appointed research fellow at Yale-NUS will also be an employee of NUS and enjoy 
NUS generous employee benefits package. The successful candidate will be
collaborating with the PI of the project (Dr. Anthony W. Lin), and 
expected to supervise a couple of interns working on the project. He/she
will also have the opportunity to interact with collaborators on the project
including Dr. Philipp Ruemmer (Uppsala University, Sweden) and
Dr. Prateek Saxena (National University of Singapore).
