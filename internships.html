    <h2>Two Internships Available
  </h2>

  <p>
Two internships are available at Yale-NUS College, Singapore, 
supervised by <a href="index.html">
Dr. Anthony Widjaja Lin</a>. A successful candidate will have an opportunity
to work on one of the following topics:
  </p>
  <ul style="line-height: 150%">
      <li>Program analysis for improving web performance (e.g. detecting
		redundant CSS rules in HTML applications).</li>
      <li>Program analysis for detecting security vulnerabilities in
          web applications (e.g. using string solving)</li>
      <li>Formal modelling and analysis of computational models in
          biology and ecology.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
A successful candidate will have an opportunity to work on either foundational 
issues (including decidability, algorithmic complexity), or implementation 
issues (including benchmarking, and optimisation), or both. 
  </p>

  <p>
An applicant should either be pursuing, or have completed, an undergraduate 
degree in computer science (or a related area).
Applications will be reviewed on a first-come, first-serve basis.
  Please email <a href="index.html">Dr. Anthony Widjaja Lin</a> for more
  information. Enquiries or expression of interests are very welcome.
