# Two PhD Studentships in Automated Reasoning Group at MPI for Software Systems

We have two openings for PhD studentships in a new Automated Reasoning Group 
led by Prof. Anthony W. Lin at MPI for Software Systems. The studentships last 
between 4-5 years. Topics are flexible, but should be in line with the research
interests of the group leader. Research interests include (but are
not limited to) automated theorem proving, software verification, verification
of parameterized systems, and applications to web security/optimization.

## Requirements
Ideally, applicants should have strong backgrounds in computer science (or
related areas like mathematics) with experience in at least one of the following
areas: logic, algorithms, programming language theory/implementation, formal
language theory, concurrency theory, and formal verification.

General requirements can be found [here](https://www.mpi-sws.org/graduate-studies/)

## Research environment
Successful applicants will work within the Automated
Reasoning Group at MPI SWS led by [Prof. Anthony W. Lin](https://anthonywlin.github.io/). This group is closely linked to his Automated
Reasoning Group at TU Kaiserslautern. Our group enjoys close collaboration
with colleagues at MPI-SWS including Prof. Rupak Majumdar, Dr. Daniel Neider, 
and Dr.  Georg Zetzsche, as well as colleagues at other institutes in Germany
(e.g. Munich), UK (Oxford, Edinburgh, Birmingham, and London), Sweden (Uppsala),
Taiwan (Taipei), China (Beijing), Australia (Melbourne, Canberra), Singapore, 
and Chile (Santiago). 

## To apply
For informal enquiries, please contact Prof. Anthony Lin (lin@cs.uni-kl.de).
To apply, please send a CV and a research statement in an email to me.
Early applications deadline is 31 December 2019. Depending on 
the remaining positions available, further applications may still be considered.
