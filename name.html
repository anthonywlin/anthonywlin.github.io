<h2>Is <b>To</b> really my surname?</h2>

<p></p>

Many people have asked me exactly this question with a strange look on their
face. Some people who process forms that I fill out even mistakenly omit it, 
thinking that I wrote it by mistake.
The answer to this question (disturbingly perhaps) is YES according to my 
passport. This is a 
name that I (mistakenly) inherited from my grandmother. 
In a nutshell, this
was a mistake on the part of Indonesian official when I applied for my passport
more than 12 years ago in Indonesia before I became an Australian. 
Over the years I found it quite troublesome to correct even when I became an
Australian (and now more troublesome after I have my publications). 
My real 
surname is <b>Lin</b>. If you can read Chinese characters, my name
is &#26519;&#23376;&#23433;. This is my real name when I was born. 
Unfortunately, due to some Indonesian political rules in the late 80s, my
real name had to be changed.

<h2>But, what is <b>To</b>? How is it pronounced?</h2>

<p></p>

<b>To</b> actually corresponds to the Chinese surname &#25140;. According
to the official Mandarin <i>pinyin</i>, this should be written <i>Dai</i> 
and pronounced roughly in this way. However, this became <b>To</b> for two 
reasons.
For one, in Indonesian language the letter T sounds more like
the letter D in English. Secondly, this is due to the reading of the surname
&#25140; using Fujian dialect; you will find many Indonesian Chinese speak
this dialect in some part of Indonesia. So, this should be pronounced something 
like 
<i>Do</i> (like the do in <i>do-re-mi-fa-sol</i>). I said <em>something 
like</em> because the English language unfortunately does not have this sound.
Indonesians pronounce the letter t <em>very much like the Chinese speakers 
pronounce d in
their pinyin</em>. Although it is closer to the English d than the English t,
it is unfortunately not really the English d.
Perhaps, to avoid confusions, I should in theory really change my surname to 
Dai or, better yet, Lin.
At any rate, I would be more than happy if people could just pronounce my last 
name as <i>Do</i> (like the do in <i>do-re-mi-fa-sol</i>) and stop calling
me <i>Too</i>.
