<h1>On Unary-conjunctive-view Queries (Honours Thesis)</h1>

<p>Author: Anthony Widjaja To</p>

<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<p>We study the computational behavior and the expressive power of the
unary-conjunctive-view (UCV) query language, which is an extension of the
Lowenheim class (i.e. monadic first-order logic) without equality. We show
that the UCV language satisfies the finite model property, i.e. every
satisfiable UCV query has a finite model. This immediately implies
decidability for the UCV language. Furthermore, we showed that satisfiability
for the UCV language is in 2-NEXPTIME but is NEXPTIME-hard. We, then, proceed
by deriving a general method for proving inexpressibility results for the UCV
language. Our method makes use of the homomorphism preservation theorem of
model theory. Then, we tap into our general methodology theorem to derive
numerous inexpressibility results for the UCV language. In particular, we
show that the following generic queries are not expressible in the UCV
language over all finite graphs: ``the existence of a k-path'' (k &gt;= 1),
``the existence of a k-cycle'' (k &gt;= 2), ``the existence of a k-clique''
(k &gt;= 2), ``that the graph is undirected'', and ``the edge relation is
transitive''. We also derive a similar result when we restrict the ground set
to `all finite undirected loopless graphs', except that this time the generic
query ``the existence of a k-clique'' (k &gt;= 1) is expressible in the
language. Despite the inexpressibility results derived in this report, we
prove that the UCV language is closed under boolean operations and
first-order quantifications - a property rarely satisfied by the known
decidable fragments of first-order logic that have formulas over any
vocabulary. Finally, we compare the UCV language with the finite variable
logic. Roughly speaking, our results stipulate that neither the UCV language
nor the k-variable logic (k &gt;= 2) is more expressive than the other.
Interestingly, we show that the 1-variable logic is strictly less expressive
than the UCV language. </p>
