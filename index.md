## NEWS
- I will be chairing the PC of CAV'26 (together with Eva Darulova and Philipp 
  Ruemmer)
- I am delighted to be invited as a keynote speaker at [VMCAI'26](https://conf.researchr.org/home/VMCAI-2026)
- I am delighted to have given an invited talk at [RP'25](https://rp25.software.imdea.org/). The invited paper can be found [here](papers/rp25-invited.pdf)

## Background
- Full Professor (W3) in Theoretical Computer Science (Automated Reasoning) and 
  Max-Planck Fellow at [University of 
  Kaiserslautern-Landau, Germany](https://www.cs.rptu.de/)
- Previously:
  - (2016 - 2019) Associate Professor in Programming Languages at [Oxford University Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) and Governing Body Fellow at [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/). I taught at the
[MSc Software Engineering Programme](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/).
  - (2014 - 2016) assistant professor at [Yale-NUS, Singapore](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg).
  - (2010-2013) EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Oxford University hosted by [Marta Kwiatkowska](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/marta.kwiatkowska/)
- Completed PhD in Informatics at University of Edinburgh in 2010 under [Leonid
  Libkin](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/libkin/) (supervisor) and [Richard Mayr](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rmayr/) (co-advisor).
- Awards (selected): ERC Consolidator Grant (2023), Amazon Research Award 
    (2021), ERC Starting Grant (2017), 
    Google Faculty Award (2017), LICS Kleene Award (2010)
- Where else I studied: BSc (Honours) at Melbourne University and MSc at
  University of Toronto
- Where I am from: I am Australian (and since recently also German) and was 
  born in Indonesia

## Research Interests
I am interested in automated reasoning (particularly over 
[strings](strings.md)), formal language theory, learning/synthesis, and
foundations of machine learning. Applications of interests include software 
verification, program synthesis, querying graph databases, machine learning, 
and computer security. My [publication page](publications.html) contains 
pretty much all my published papers.

Selected Tool:
- [OSTRICH](https://github.com/uuverifiers/ostrich/) - our string solver
  supporting complex constraints (concatenation, real-world regexes, lengths, 
  transducers) that primarily exploit regular constraint propagation.
