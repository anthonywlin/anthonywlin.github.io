## NEWS
- I will be giving a [tutorial on string solving at POPL'24](https://popl24.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2024-tutorialfest/3/String-Solving-for-Verification)
- Our string solver OSTRICH won [QF_S (Single Query Track) in SMT-COMP 2023](https://smt-comp.github.io/2023/results/qf-s-single-query)!
- ![Image](ERC_logo_small.jpeg) I am delighted to have received an ERC
[Consolidator Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/erc-2022-consolidator-grants-results) on Logic and
  Automata over Sequences with Data. I will be looking for PhD Students and
  Postdoc Researchers soon. Please let me know if you are interested.

## Background
- Professor in Theoretical Computer Science (Automated Reasoning) and 
  Max-Planck Fellow at [Technical University of 
  Kaiserslautern, Germany](https://www.informatik.uni-kl.de/)
- Previously:
  - (2016 - 2019) Associate Professor in Programming Languages at [Oxford University Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) and Governing Body Fellow at [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/). I taught at the
[MSc Software Engineering Programme](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/).
  - (2014 - 2016) assistant professor at [Yale-NUS, Singapore](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg).
  - (2010-2013) EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Oxford University hosted by [Marta Kwiatkowska](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/marta.kwiatkowska/)
- Completed PhD in Informatics at University of Edinburgh in 2010 under [Leonid
  Libkin](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/libkin/) (supervisor) and [Richard Mayr](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rmayr/) (co-advisor).
- Where else I studied: BSc (Honours) at Melbourne University and MSc at
  University of Toronto
- Where I am from: I am Australian and was born in Indonesia

## Research Interests
I am interested in automated reasoning and logic/automata techniques, especially
constraint solving (particularly over [strings](strings.md)) and 
learning/synthesis methods. Applications of interests
include software verification, computer security, program synthesis,
querying graph databases, and interpretable machine learning. My [publication
page](publications.html) contains pretty much all my published papers.

Selected Tool:
- [OSTRICH](https://github.com/uuverifiers/ostrich/) - our string solver
  supporting complex constraints (concatenation, real-world regexes, lengths, 
  transducers) that primarily exploit regular constraint propagation.
