- ![Image](ERC_logo_small.jpeg) I am delighted to have received an ERC
[Consolidator Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/erc-2022-consolidator-grants-results) on Logic and
  Automata over Sequences with Data. I will be looking for PhD Students and
  Postdoc Researchers soon. Please let me know if you are interested.
- Two papers appearing in LICS'22.
- A [new graph database paper](papers/pods22.pdf) appearing in PODS'22.
- I am delighted to be invited to present at [SynCoP'22](https://project.inria.fr/syncop22/). The slides can be found [here](slides/syncop22.pdf).
- [Two new papers](publications.html) on string solving appearing in CPP'22 
(Distinguished Paper Award) and POPL'22.
- Aug'21: Amazon Research Award - thank you for the generous support
- I am delighted to be invited to present at [TPSS'21](https://tpss-workshop.github.io/). Here are my [slides](slides/TPSS21.pdf).

## Background
- Professor in Theoretical Computer Science (Automated Reasoning), ERC 
Starting Grant Fellow, and Max-Planck Fellow at [Technical University of 
Kaiserslautern, Germany](https://www.informatik.uni-kl.de/)
- Previously:
  - (2016 - 2019) Associate Professor in Programming Languages at [Oxford University Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) and Governing Body Fellow at [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/). I taught at the
[MSc Software Engineering Programme](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/).
  - (2014 - 2016) assistant professor at [Yale-NUS, Singapore](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg).
  - (2010-2013) EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Oxford University hosted by [Marta Kwiatkowska](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/marta.kwiatkowska/)
- Completed PhD in Informatics at University of Edinburgh in 2010 under [Leonid
  Libkin](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/libkin/) (supervisor) and [Richard Mayr](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rmayr/) (co-advisor).

## Research Interests
I am interested in automated reasoning and logic/automata techniques, especially
constraint solving (particularly over [strings](strings.md)) and 
learning/synthesis methods. Applications of interests
include software verification, computer security, program synthesis,
querying graph databases, and interpretable machine learning. My [publication
page](publications.html) contains pretty much all my published papers.

Selected Tool:
- [OSTRICH](https://github.com/uuverifiers/ostrich/) - our string solver
  supporting complex constraints (concatenation, real-world regexes, lengths, 
  transducers) that primarily exploit regular constraint propagation.
