# Algorithmic Verification of String-Manipulating Programs (AV-SMP)

This is the page for the currently active project AV-SMP supported by ERC 
Starting Grant.
The purpose of the project is to study foundational issues concerning
string constraint solving, and their applications to verification of
string-manipulating programs. This project is currently hosted at 
TU Kaiserslautern, and was hosted from November 2018 to February 2020 at 
University of Oxford. Check out our string solver [OSTRICH](https://github.com/pruemmer/ostrich).
